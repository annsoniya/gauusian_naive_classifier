Gaussian na√Øve Bayes classifier with uniform prior
Probability distributions were estimated from labeled data points in each class
new datum was classified by estimating the posterior probability for each class and assigning it to the class with the maximum probability.
We validated stimulus-decoding accuracy with a 20-fold cross-validation.
Shuffled data were constructed from the same fluorescence data but the label for tone identity was randomized. The 95% confidence interval for shuffled data was calculated by iterating the classification of shuffled data 100 times and taking the values of the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.
